## Project

This was written as my final year project for Bsc Computing Science at the University of Strathclyde.

## Running the project

You can access these links: [pathfinding](https://marklee7916.github.io/AI-Search-Algorithm-Visualisation-Experimental/public/#/pathfinding), [constraint satisfaction](https://marklee7916.github.io/AI-Search-Algorithm-Visualisation-Experimental/public/#/n-queens) and [adversarial search](https://marklee7916.github.io/AI-Search-Algorithm-Visualisation-Experimental/public/#/minimax)

## TODO

Get rid of magic strings for localStorage access in the minimax and backtracking modules

Proper detection of whether a user is on mobile

Refresh page properly when user changes screen size on PC

Pull in default variables in tests (particularly pathfinding.component.spec.ts) to make less brittle

Potentially better encapsulation for data structures (this is debatable, makes code safer but more boilerplate and more code to maintain)

Potentially get rid of HostListeners if performance becomes an issue

More intelligent responsive design for mobile
