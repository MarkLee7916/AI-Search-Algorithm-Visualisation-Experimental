  <p class="modal-text">
    So what is a pathfinding algorithm? A pathfinding algorithm is an algorithm
    that tries to find a path between two points, in this case two tiles in a
    grid. From the point of view of the algorithm we don't know what lies ahead
    of us, we just know where we currently are, what we've already seen and
    whether the current tile we're on is the goal. The general procedure is to
    keep track of what tiles we've seen by storing them away in an agenda. We
    start at the start tile and add all of its neighbours to the agenda. We then
    take a tile from the agenda and add all of its neighbours to the agenda.
    This process is repeated until we reach the goal. How do we decide which
    tile to take from the agenda? That's how all the algorithms we'll explore
    differ from one another.

  <h1 class="modal-title">Applications</h1>

  <p class="modal-text">
    There are many applications for these algorithms. Whenever we need to find a
    path between any two points automatically (i.e google maps, finding a route
    in a video game) we‚Äôll use a pathfinding algorithm. However, they also have
    a lot of applications that aren‚Äôt obvious at first glance. For instance, we
    can use them to solve rubix cubes by treating all the possible
    configurations of the cubes as points, and connections between any cubes
    that can be moved between by turning the cube. This forms a network, which
    can be explored using pathfinding algorithms. The path we get back can be
    used as a series of steps needed to solve the cube.

  <p class="modal-text">
    With this setup we can‚Äôt make a very clever algorithm, but we can still find
    any existing path and even guarantee that it‚Äôs the shortest. We just explore
    the grid until we hit the goal. How do we decide what tile to take from the
    agenda next?
  </p>

  <p class="modal-text">
    One approach is to use stack (like a stack of papers) as the agenda. Since
    stacks follow a last in first out order, the tile we take from the stack
    will be the one seen most recently. This won‚Äôt find the shortest path, but
    it will find any path if it exists. This is called a "depth first search".
  </p>

  <p class="modal-text">
    Another approach is to use a queue (like a queue outside a shop) as the
    agenda. Since a queue is first in first out the tile we take from the queue
    will be the one seen least recently. This is called a "breadth first
    search". This guarantees the shortest path, but why? When we explore, we
    start by adding all neighbours of the starting tile into the queue. These
    tiles are all one tile away from the starting tile. When we visit the next
    tile, we add all of its neighbours onto the queue, which are two tiles away
    from the starting tile. Since this is a queue, we explore all the tiles we
    seen least recently. Since the tiles that were one away were added first,
    we‚Äôll get through all the tiles that are one away before we consider any
    tile two tiles away from the starting tile. This idea continues throughout
    the algorithm; we‚Äôll consider the tiles that are two away before we consider
    the tiles that are three away and so on‚Ä¶ When we visit the goal we know
    we‚Äôve found the shortest way to get to it, because if a shorter way existed
    we‚Äôd have seen it before. Say the goal was 10 tiles away from the starting
    tile. We‚Äôve already explored all the tiles at distances that are within 9
    tiles away, and none of them were the goal, so we know for sure that the way
    we‚Äôve got to the goal is the minimum distance, which means that it must also
    be the shortest path.

  <h1 class="modal-title">Weighted Search</h1>

  <p class="modal-text">
    When you‚Äôre exploring the world not all roads are created equal. Some are
    smooth and easy to drive on, while some are bumpy and full of potholes. So
    what seems like the shortest path might not actually be the shortest path if
    we have to cross a bunch of badly paved roads. To model this, we can assign
    a tile a weight which tells us how much it costs to cross it. To find the
    shortest path, some algorithms will try to minimise the total cost.
    Algorithms that do this are weighted. However some algorithms simply ignore
    these weights. These algorithms are unweighted.
  </p>

  <p class="modal-text">
    Breadth first search and depth first search don‚Äôt consider these weights, so
    we need a new algorithm, namely Dijkstra‚Äôs. The idea behind Dijkstra‚Äôs is to
    keep track of the total cost to get to each tile as we explore the grid. For
    instance if to get to a tile we had to get through tiles of weights 1, 2,
    and 3, then the total cost would be 6. When it comes to selecting which tile
    to visit next, we always pick the tile with the lowest total cost. This
    guarantees the shortest path for weighted grids, but why? The reasoning is
    similar to breadth first search. Since we always look at tile that are the
    smallest cost, we know that when we reach the goal there can‚Äôt have been a
    shorter path to the goal, as we would have already seen it before.

  <p class="modal-text">
    You may be wondering, what if we actually know where the goal is? For
    instance in a grid what if we could say for sure ‚Äúthe goal is in position
    (10, 10)‚Äù? We don‚Äôt necessarily know how to get to the goal, but we know
    what direction we should be looking in at least.
  </p>

  <p class="modal-text">
    Since this is a coordinate system, we can estimate the distance from the
    goal if we know what coordinate the goal is in. For instance if we‚Äôre at the
    coordinate (5, 5) and the goal is at (10, 10) then we can estimate the
    distance from the goal to be a total of 10 steps. Note that this is just an
    estimate. There could be obstacles that prevent us from actually getting
    there in 10 steps, but it still helps us move in the right direction. This
    leads to an algorithm called "best first search". The idea is to always pick
    the tile with the smallest estimated distance to the goal. This gets us to
    the goal quickly because we won‚Äôt waste time searching in the wrong
    direction.

<div class="modal-slide" *ngIf="slides[slideIndex] === Slide.AStar">
  <h1 class="modal-title">The A* algorithm</h1>

  <p class="modal-text">
    A* allows us to use the estimated distance from the goal to find a path
    quickly, but always guarantees the shortest path. On top of that it also
    works for weighted graphs. The idea is to always pick the tile that has the
    minimum value of
    <br />
    <br />
    <em>
      total cost to get to here from start + estimated distance from here to the
      goal
    </em>
    <br />
    <br />
    We can see why this will help us reach the goal faster. If a tile is far
    away from the goal, A* is less likely to pick it as the estimated distance
    is a factor in how it picks which tile to explore next. However, it‚Äôs not so
    obvious why this will give us the shortest path. In fact, A* will only
    guarantee the shortest path if our estimate never overestimates the
    distance. But why? Say we have just discovered a tile, and we know it‚Äôs the
    goal. We want to know for certain that for any other tile in the grid, the
    distance between that tile and the goal added to the distance between that
    tile and the start is greater than the distance from the start to the goal
    we've just calculated. In other words, we want to know that for any tile
    <br />
    <br />
    <em>
      total cost to get to tile from start + actual distance from tile to goal
      >= total cost to get from start to goal
    </em>
    <br />
    <br />
    We already know that, since this is the first time we‚Äôve visited the goal,
    that
    <br />
    <br />
    <em>
      total cost to get to tile from start + estimated distance from tile to
      goal >= total cost to get from start to goal
    </em>
    <br />
    <br />
    Since we know the estimated distance will always be smaller than the actual
    distance, we know that the formula we want will always hold. Therefore A*
    will always find the shortest path if we never overestimate the distance.
    This may be a bit unintuitive, but another way to think of it is this:
    ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let a large overestimate put you off the shortest path‚Äù

    Dijsktra's is on the left and A* is on the right. As you can see, A* gets

    doing less work.
