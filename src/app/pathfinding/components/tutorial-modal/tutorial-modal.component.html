      This is a project that aims to help students learn about pathfinding
      algorithms through visualisation. This app works by animating the process
      that pathfinding algorithms go through when trying to find a path in a 2D
      grid. It was written by Mark Lee as his final year project for BSc
      Computer Science at the University of Strathclyde.

      These slides will guide you through the features of the application. You
      can navigate through the slides using the buttons at the bottom left and
      bottom right corners of the current slide.

    <p class="modal-text">
      A general tip for using algorithm visualisation tools: it's better to try
      and actively learn than passively learn. When stepping through an
      algorithm, try and predict what it will do next. If you're right, then it
      shows you understand the algorithm. If you're wrong, it's worth wondering
      why that is and comparing your result with the actual one.

  <h1 class="modal-title">Mapping a 2D grid onto Graph Theory</h1>

  <span class="modal-content">
    <p class="modal-text">
      Weights are applied to tiles themselves rather than the connections
      between them. Therefore you can view the grid as a directed graph where
      two tiles being adjacent corresponds to two edges existing between them.
      Both edges will be directed in opposite directions allowing bidirectional
      travel between the tiles. The weight of any edge directed towards a tile
      will be the weight assigned to that tile in the 2D grid. How adjacency is
      defined is configurable through the menu, and includes horizontal and
      vertical adjacency only, diagonal adjacency only and both. The example
      below is vertical and horizontal adjacency only.
    </p>

    <p class="modal-text">
      However, it's probably easier to think of a weight as the cost of passing
      through a tile rather than thinking of it in terms of edges.

  <span class="modal-content">
    <p class="modal-text">
      You can add obstacles to see how the algorithm will get around them. This
      is done through holding down the mouse left button and dragging it along
      the grid, which draws obstacles along every tile the mouse has touched.
      Obstacles come in two modes; barriers and weights. You can configure which
      one is being drawn in the dropdown menu under "Item Placed On Tile"
    </p>

    <p class="modal-text">
      Barriers block the algorithm from passing completely, forcing it to find
      another way around. Weights assign a cost to passing through, which
      disincentivizes algorithms if they're aiming to find the shortest path.
      Note that only A* and Dijkstra's take weights into account; any other
      algorithm will ignore them.

      As well as generating random weights, you can also add weights with values
      of your choosing. This is done by selecting the "Custom Weight" option in
      the menu under "Item Placed On Tile". When you click on a tile it will
      display an input box that allows you to enter the weight you want to place
      at that tile. This weight needs to be a positive integer. You can either
      press the button or the enter key to submit the value.

      Instead of drawing barriers and weights manually you can automatically

      configured using the "Random Grid" dropdown and mazes are generated using
      the "Generate Maze" button. If you have "Place Barriers" selected it will
      generate a maze of barriers and if you have "Place Weights" selected it
      will generate a maze of weights.

      sets up a predefined quiz case and asks you to guess what tile the
      algorithm will expand next. If you guess the correct tile, it will advance
      to the next frame and ask you to guess the next tile to be expanded and so
      on.
