  <h1 class="modal-title">Welcome to Pathfinding Visualiser!</h1>

  <p class="modal-text">
    This is a project that aims to help students learn about pathfinding
    algorithms through visualisation. This app works by animating the process
    that pathfinding algorithms go through when trying to find a path in a 2D
    grid. It was written by Mark Lee as his final year project for BSc Computer
    Science at the University of Strathclyde.

  <p class="modal-text">
    These slides will guide you through the features of the application. You can
    navigate through the slides using the buttons at the bottom left and bottom
    right corners of the current slide.

  <p class="modal-text">
    A general tip for using algorithm visualisation tools: it's better to try
    and actively learn than passively learn. When stepping through an algorithm,
    try and predict what it will do next. If you're right, then it shows you
    understand the algorithm. If you're wrong, it's worth wondering why that is
    and comparing your result with the actual one.

  <h1 class="modal-title">Mapping a 2D grid onto Graph Theory</h1>

  <p class="modal-text">
    Weights are applied to tiles themselves rather than the connections between
    them. Therefore you can view the grid as a directed graph where two tiles
    being adjacent corresponds to two edges existing between them. Both edges
    will be directed in opposite directions allowing bidirectional travel
    between the tiles. The weight of any edge directed towards a tile will be
    the weight assigned to that tile in the 2D grid. How adjacency is defined is
    configurable through the menu, and includes horizontal and vertical
    adjacency only, diagonal adjacency only and both. The example below is
    vertical and horizontal adjacency only.
  </p>

  <p class="modal-text">
    However, it's probably easier to think of a weight as the cost of passing
    through a tile rather than thinking of it in terms of edges.

  <h1 class="modal-title">Barriers and Weights</h1>

  <p class="modal-text">
    You can add obstacles to see how the algorithm will get around them. This is
    done through holding down the mouse left button and dragging it along the
    grid, which draws obstacles along every tile the mouse has touched.
    Obstacles come in two modes; barriers and weights. You can configure which
    one is being drawn in the dropdown menu under "Place Barriers"
  </p>

  <p class="modal-text">
    Barriers block the algorithm from passing completely, forcing it to find
    another way around. Weights assign a cost to passing through, which
    disincentivizes algorithms if they're aiming to find the shortest path. Note
    that only A* and Dijkstra's take weights into account; any other algorithm
    will ignore them.

  <h1 class="modal-title">Maze Generation</h1>

  <p class="modal-text">
    Instead of drawing barriers and weights manually you can automatically
    generate mazes for the algorithm to explore. The type of maze is configured
    using the "Random Grid" dropdown and mazes are generated using the "Generate
    Maze" button. If you have "Place Barriers" selected it will generate a maze
    of barriers and if you have "Place Weights" selected it will generate a maze
    of weights.

    To animate an algorithm simply press the "‚èØ" button. While an algorithm is

    "Set Animation Delay".
